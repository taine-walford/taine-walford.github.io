Purposes:
- To showcase my work at EDA
- To showcase my skills
- To document my work and ideas
- Experience and experimentation

My audience is adults/academics/employers

How will I build my site to support their experience?
- Keep it simple intially. Clear cut blocks of information (posts)
- Treat it like tumblr posts

I will need a few extra directories, but for now I will only use /images.

The <body> will have it's style, and each post will inherit the <post> style, which will be similar but obviously seperated for control.
