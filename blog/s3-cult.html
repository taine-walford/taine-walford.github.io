        <h3> What is EQ? </h3>
        <p>
            EQ stands for Emotional Quotient, but is taken to mean Emotional Intelligence. EQ tends to be more important than IQ.
            There are five categories of EQ:
        </p>
        <h3> Self awareness </h3>
        <p>
            The ability to recognize your emotions as they happen is key to EQ. This allows tuning into your true feelings, and the habit og evaluating your emotions as they happen allow you to manage them much better. THe key elements are Emotional Awareness, and Self-confidence.
        </p>
        <h3> Self-regulation </h3>
        <p>
            You often have litle control over emotions, but with the attention and awareness a high EQ gives you, you can mitigate the effects of stronger emotions like anger, anxiety, or sadness. Key elements are Self-control, Trustworthiness, Conscientiousness, Adaptability, and Innovation.
        </p>
        <h3> Motivation </h3>
        <p>
            Motivation requires clear-cut concise goals and a positive attitude. Awareness helps you catch negative thoughts, which you can then reframe witha positive vibe. Key elements are Drive, Commitment, Initiative, and Optimism.
        </p>
        <h3> Empathy </h3>
        <p>
            Recognizing how people feel is integral to maintaining strong relationships. Better controlling your own signals or aura and by recognizing other's signals/aura, you can relate and choose the right way to deal with sitautions. Key strengths are Service, Development of others, Leveraging diversity, Political awarenes and Understanding others.
        </p>
        <h3> Social Skills </h3>

The most imporatnt skills are Influencing, Communication, Leadership, being a catalyst for change, Conflict Management, building bonds dattebayo, collaboration and team strength.
        </p><br>
        <h3> What makes it different from IQ? </h3>
        <p>
                At one point in time, IQ was viewed as the primary determinant of success. People with high IQs were assumed to be destined for a life of accomplishment and achievement and researchers debated whether intelligence was the product of genes or the environment (the old nature versus nurture debate).
                However, some critics began to realize that not only was high intelligence no guarantee for success in life, it was also perhaps too narrow a concept to fully encompass the wide range of human abilities and knowledge.
                IQ is still recognized as an important element of success, particularly when it comes to academic achievement. People with high IQs typically to do well in school, often earn more money, and tend to be healthier in general. But today experts recognize it is not the only determinate of life success. Instead, it is part of a complex array of influences that includes emotional intelligence among other things.</p><br>
        <h3> Why is it important? </h3>
        <p>
            Once the threshold for base IQ is reached, everything else is EQ. IQ is only useful for when you don't hit the base, but once everyone is at that base level only EQ matters. It doesn't matter if you double or triple the base, without EQ you cannot progress.
