        <h3> Personal Values </h3>
        <p>
            My partner Cindy named my important personal values as: <br> - Respect <br> - Family <br> - Integrity <br> - Ambition <br>  - Dedication <br> in that order. I will go into detail on each one later. <br>
            <br>
            My personal values list, however: <br>  - Passion <br>  - Power <br>  - Strength <br>  - Ambition <br> - Family <br>
            in this order, lead from one to another. I'll first talk about Cindy's list, then mine. <br>
            <br>
            - Mutual respect is definitely a good one, but an important part of this is that I always respect people as a base. Everyone starts off in my good books. I will only change my mind when they give me a reason to. <br>
            - Family is definitely a big one. I make a point of being affectionate and happy to see everyone no matter what, even if I don't feel like it. I'm just a big doting uncle to the kids, but when they grow up they will understand my passion for the people that share my blood. They all root from my most respected person - my grandmother - and I'm going to let my love for her spread to everyone that she loves as well. <br>
            - Integrity was not so much 'I do what I say', but more of 'I'll be who I am', in that I will always do what I feel like and I will stay true to who I am and who I want to be. <br>
            - Ambition ties into the intergrity value, but I strive to be the best me I can, hoping to overtake the me of yesterday. As long as I better who I was yesterday, then I'm doing well; But Cindy knows that I don't really plan on stopping ever. I don't have a goal that I want to meet and then stop, I want to see how far I can go along my path. <br> 
            - Dedication is a bit of a strange one, as she knows that I change things up often and I never really stick to the same hobbies, but I am dedicated to my family and my future children, so I guess that's okay. <br> <br>
            <br>
            My personal list is a more straightforward, but sounds very anime-esque at this point. <br><br>
            - Passion is my most important value. If you don't have passion for what you're doing, I feel like you aren't living. Passion isn't incentive to do things, I do things for my passion. I love many things, and really feeling the emotion in situations is something that I appreciate beyond many things. A calm morning with my siblings just chilling around in blankets, or a DMC at 4am, lots of different things that leave lasting impressions on my mould my passion for things and let me continue appreciating and chasing these moments. <br>
            - Power is what I need behind my passion, the passion for something is one value but having power behind it is the fun, driving force. The more passion, the more power, the better I feel about something and the better I perform. <br>
            - Strength is not the power I put behind it, but the strength I can follow up with. I can use my passion with 100% of my power, but I need to raise my strength to push how far my 100% power will take me. <br>
            - Ambition allows me to dream and to plan, exploring my ideas and wishes to create passion to turn those dreams into goals and then meet those goals. That's what I need ambition for, to strive for the impossible to create emotion that drives me to where my heart wants me to be. <br>
            - Family doesn't tie into this as well but they will be a strong player in my life, in the decisions I make. Once Cindy finishes her degree, we're moving back home to be with my fmaily for two years before returning for her post-grad. I'm already making decisions for my family and once I become stronger I will be able to be there for them as much I want to. <br>
