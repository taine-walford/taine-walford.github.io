            <h2> Final Core </h2> 
            <h2 style="text-align: right;"> 21-5-19 </h2>

        <h3>Sprint 1 - Thinking like a programmer</h3>
        <p>
          I found coding when I was in early intermediate, and I thinkit dramatically changed how I thought about problems. 
          Most of the real thinking and problem solving came from intermediate and onwards, and learning programming alongside really 
          did shape the way I thought for the better. It's handy seeing core principles of this style of thinking, and looking to them 
          for help in consolidating ideas into code.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Sprint 1 - Strengths and Weaknesses</h3>
        <p>
          Learning your strengths and weaknesses are good in every case, and when approaching a time of such rapid development, 
          understanding what you cna leverage and what you can work on is going to streamline the process.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Sprint 2 - Learning Plan</h3>
        <p>
          My learning plan so far has not been kept to at all, and I will have to reevaluate it geared towards bootcamp.
          I do think it is a good plan, but being at campus will dramatically change that.
        </p> <br>
        <h3>Sprint 3 - Emotional Intelligence</h3>
        <p>
          Emotional Intellignce was my favourite core learning as it was actually very interesting and something new that is 
          clearly effective. I will keep my emotional development in mind as I progress.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Sprint 5 - Neuroplasticity</h3> 
        <p>
          Neuroplasticity is something that I came to understand in highschool but not something I strived for, and I have 
          limited mylsef by not understanding just how monstrous humans congnitive abilities can become.
        </p><br>
        <h3>SPrint 5 - Looping</h3> 
        <p>
          Listening and looping is an interesting development as I have experience in arguments and debates, with emotional topics 
          and not, but it's hard to take exactly what the other actually means in the heat of the moment, and this exercise is brilliant 
          for strengthening communication.
