        <h3> Limitations </h3>
        <p>
            As a child, I thought I had lots of strengths. I had no trouble breezing through the work at school, I had no trouble getting high grades and always had the rights answers. Until I faced the reality, I thought that my ease was a sign of strength.It is a sign of strength, but unfortunately, that means that I faced no challenges for a large part of my education. As I see it now, challenges are the telltale sign that you are on the right path. In a video game, you run around until you find enemies. They are your sign that you're nearing the end of the level. <BR>
            All I did was dick around in the tutorial room for 20 years. <br>
            <br>
            So, problems learning, problems seeking challange on my own, problems seeking development independently. That's on the list. <br>
            <br>
            When I was younger my mother had me tested at a facility, and their results make me laugh still. Several qualities they listed I had proven well over the years. My favourite was that, when I was 4, they concluded that my time perception and management was utterly awful. And I had proven that for 18 years before stumbling across the report and reading it. Really, really just not great with time. <br>
            <br>
            When solving a problem, I will likely blurt out the next step immediately. I like to get the ball rolling as soon as possible, to build up momentum to quickly get the problem out of the way. This means that, when I've made the wrong choice and taken the wrong path due to haste and lack of critical thinking, I'm halfway done. I spend double the effort to first solve the wrong problem, and then go back and solve the correct problem. <br>
            <br>
            These three limitations are what I wll focus on developing the most during these next few months. <br>
            <br>
            On the contrary, when I choose the right path of solving a problem, it is solved quickly and in a clearcut way. The best way to describe my method would simply be stepping stones, one stone at a time. <br>
            <br>
            I'm passionate about lots of things, but I'm even passionate about situations and moments. I want to feel emotional, whether it's a rush or an accomplishment. <br>
            Due to this, my passion and my aim to experience lots of new challenges and situations, I am very open to new people and will try to hold conversations with as many people as I can. <br>
            <br>
            These strengths are things that pale to what I need to accomplish to develop into the man I want to be at the end of this, my plate is full with goals.<br>
