            <h2> Final Plan </h2> 
            <h2 style="text-align: right;"> 21-5-19 </h2>
        </div>
        <h3>Long Term Goal:</h3>
        <p>
          Leave something behind. Specifically a story of my own, but my career is simply 
          something that challenges me and something that I can take to the highest level.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Workload management:</h3>
        <p>
          Bootcamp is going to be set hours, so show up and stay until I have the day under wraps. 
          I don't plan on staying much longer than 6, but what happens will happen. I aim to have 
          prepped breakfast and lunch before I leave, and to eat on campus. If I am struggling with 
          workloads, I intend on staying a little longer than intended, and will just grab dinner 
          somewhere close.
        </p><br>
        <p>
          In terms of priority, deadlines work really well with me, so I will be dividing the work 
          and giving myself a deadline to meet which will allow myself to gauge how long I will take 
          to complete the task and see how much break I can afford to take. A lot of the work is going 
          to be done on campus with others to help and to chat with, which will allow me to develop 
          my teamwork and coding with others, which is likely going to be a challenge at first. 
        </p> <br>
        <h3>Skill development focuses:</h3>
        <p>
           - Critical mind: I don't struggle with being open with opinions and with making leader 
           decisions, however I need to learn to evaluate better and make better decisions. I find 
           too often that I say something without any critical thought behind it. <br>
           - Calm: I struggle with taking a step back and not being lost in the moment, which I 
           will be working on. I love the rush of the moment and getting insane focus on something,
            but sometimes that isn't what I should be focused on. <br>
          - Time management: Time management in both macro and micro sense; Making sure that I'm
           using my time wisely in the long run but also in the moment. <br>
          <h3> Strengths</h3>
          <p>
            - Confident in myself and quick to throw out ideas <br>
            - Good problem solving skills <br>
            - Passionate about a lot of things <br>
            - Open with people and glad to make new friends <br>
          </p>
          <h3>Limitations</h3>
          <p>
            - Struggle with studying/learning <br>
            - Awful at time management
            - Problem solving skillset leans toward immediate solutions over a better solution
