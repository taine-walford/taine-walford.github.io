        <h3> The DOM </h3>
        <p>
            The DOM (Document Object Model) is a system that allows interaction between HTML, DOM, and JS. It exists to be used with any theoretical language, but JS is very common. The DOM's 'link' allows for JS code to effect HTML and CSS from within, allowing for a lot more options and creating a much more dynamic page. For example, I could use JS to check whether a page had been scrolled or not, and then use the JS to tell an HTML element to disappear with the scroll distance caled.
        </p> <br>
        <h3> HTML + CSS </h3>
        <p> I like to think of the DOM as a big, apartment building. It holds a large container (<body>), which is then split into levels, which then have their own apartments, which in turns have rooms. Each new separation is a new HTML element that can house even more elements inside. The DOM holds the building and the plans, and then the HTML elements define how each apartment is built. CSS comes into this by essentially being the interior designer. You can use CSS to apply styles to entire floors (like a class), a single house (a single element), or even a single room inside that. This changes how the room looks, but doesn't change the layout or whether each room is the kitchen/bathroom, etc, simply how each one looks.
            HTML elements are placed along the DOM and the CSS styles change the way each one looks.</p> <br>
        <h3> Arrays + Objects </h3>
        <p> Arrays and objects are two ways of storing data in JS, and both extremely common. 
            Arrays are like a sequential data type, with data being held in orders, and reffered to in order.</p>

        </div> <br>
           <p> Objects are data types that encompass a little more. They are given a name, and data is stored in attributes of the object.</p>

        <h3> Functions </h3>
        <p> I like to think of functions as instruction sets. You define a set of code you want to be run, you give it an output, and then you bundle that up as a function. You can then pass data to the function, it will run the code, and then you will get the output. Functions are essential to save time and for code readability.</p>

        <h3> Control Flow </h3>
        <p> Control Flow
                Each line of code is executed sequentially, however there are other structures that change this. For instance, a JS function will cause the code to jump to the current function, execute that sequentially, and then return back to the line the function was called on. Another structure that changes the flow is a loop; There are a few lops but essentially loops will contuniually loop (nice) code until a condition is met. The type of loop determines it's behavioiur while it is running. </p>
