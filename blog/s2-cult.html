        <h3>Long term goal:</h3>
        <p>
            Leave something behind. Specifically a story of my own, but my career is simply something that challenges me and something that I can take to the highest level.
        </p>
          <h3>What human skills will you develop at EDA:</h3>
        <p>
            - Critical mind: I don't struggle with being open with opinions and with making leader decisions, however I need to learn to evaluate better and make better decisions. I find too often that I say something without any critical thought behind it.<br>
            - Calm: I struggle with taking a step back and not being lost in the moment, which I will be working on. I love the rush of the moment and getting insane focus on something, but sometimes that isn't what I should be focused on.<br>
            - Time management: Time management in both macro and micro sense; Making sure that I'm using my time wisely in the long run but also in the moment. <br>
        </p>
        <h3> Strengths: </h3>
        <p>
            - Confident in myself and quick to throw out ideas <br>
            - Good problem solving skills  <br>
            - Passionate about a lot of things  <br>
            - Open with people and glad to make new friends  <br>
        </p>
        <h3> Limitations: </h3>
        <p>
            - Struggle with studying/learning <br>
            - Awful at time management  <br>
            - Problem solving skillset leans toward immediate solutions over a better solution  <br>
        </p>
        <h3> Workload management: </h3>
        <p>
            Due to working the weekends, Monday has been my relaxing day with Tues- Sat afternoon being my work-week.<br>
            In this time I need to divvy up the workload into what needs to be completed, and then into what days I do what, and then give myself hard deadlines that I need to meet.<br>
            <span style="font-weight: italic;"> This will help with my time management and hone my mind to remain calm and focused on the bigger picture.</span> <br>
            Aside from working, I have no commitments at the moment, meaning I can focus a large chunk of my time into my learning plan. I aim to spend 5ish hours on campus per day, to allow for some socializing before Bootcamp starts. This will open up conversation, allow new situations, and I can seek help quickly and with multiple people. <br>
            <span style="font-weight: italic;"> This will allow me to push my critical mind and allow for maximum change in my mind. </span> <br> 
            Due to the nature of a flipped classroom, I except Chris to take a spectator role and oversee my learning by checking in with me. If he has to seek me out, obviously I'm not doing well.
