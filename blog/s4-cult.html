        <h3>The principles of Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
          Looking back, I realized that I still thought of kids as being 'smart' or 'average' or 'stupid' up until I was even 14/15 years old. I'm not sure when I understood that working harder 
          and learning a subjet will 'bleed' out as general intelligence, but it's something I came to intuitively understand. Had I known that earlier I'm sure I not only would have pushed myself 
          harder, but I would have encouraged my friends to push their own limits and expand their horizons. I feel that knowing this is empowering and makes you feel that your destiny is in your own hands.
        </p><br>
        <p>
            A big factor of neuroplasticity is the key 'Use it or lose it'. Explained in a changing highway metaphor: A road highway that has lots of cars passing through ii will gain lanes, while a highway 
            with less cars will lose lanes. Cars represent neurons, and the highways are the connections that bridge them together. By using certain pathways by revisiting thoughts and by having similar thoughts, 
            you can strengthen the connections and the make the ideas be recalled faster and also strengthen the nearby neurons.
            By continuously, slowly and consisely 'training' your brain, you can create strong bonds between thoughts.
        </p><br>
        <h3>Ways to increase Neuroplasticity</h3>
        <p>
            Being specific with the training of your brain allows for more concise changes. The nature of the training dictates the changes in the brain, as slow training will create a strong foundation, 
            and quick bursts will result in the changes lasting shorter periods. Change in your brain requires sufficient repititon. Practice makes permanent. Transference is an interesting idea, 
            in that changes in one function may positively effect another, simliar function. Learning and changing the brains pathways postively effect the entire brain.

        <h3>Growth Mindset</h3>
        <p>
            Recent advances in neuroscience have shown us that the brain is far more malleable than we ever knew. Research on brain plasticity has shown how connectivity between neurons can change with experience. 
            With practice, neural networks grow new connections, strengthen existing ones, and build insulation that speeds transmission of impulses. These neuroscientific discoveries have shown us that we can 
            increase our neural growth by the actions we take, such as using good strategies, asking questions, practicing, and following good nutrition and sleep habits.
        </p>
        <h3> Personal changes</h3> 
        <p>
            Nothing new was learnt or found, I already had a good grasp on a growth mindset and I understand that a strong habit in an unrelated area of myself will bleed into other unexpected areas and will push me further.
            I have already integrated and am currently cultivating a strong mindset and habits to push me as far as I can go.
